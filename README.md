I am Martin. A little bit information for me:

I'm a recent graduate of the Alpha JavaScript track at Telerik Academy, embarking on my programming journey with curiosity and passion. Though still at the beginning of my path, my desire to learn and grow in the tech field is boundless. Beyond code, I'm an avid sports enthusiast, with a particular fondness for football and volleyball. Animals hold a special place in my heart, just as much as I cherish the adventures of reading, traveling, and exploring the world of healthy eating. Excited to contribute, learn, and collaborate in this vibrant community!

Additional information:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my coding skills.
- ðŸŽ“ I have a bachelor's degree in Tourism from Sofia University.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about football, but never about politics.
